# Lesson 1.3: Functional Exceptions Part 2

In the previous lesson, you probably made a `raise` function that looks like this:

```javascript
function raise() {
  return "Fail!"
}
```

And you probably made a `tryWith` function that looks like this:

```javascript
function tryWith(result) {
  if (result === "Fail!") return "Error!";
  return result;
}
```

It's clear that this is not exactly the most sophisticated of implementations. Some might even call it a hack! The downsides of this approach are obvious. For starters, lots of things, not just our `raise` function, return `"Fail!"`, so we might catch an excetion where none actually existed.

Instead of using strings or `null` values or whatever, what if we made our own custom object for exceptions? Using the magic of TypeScript, we don't have to stop at creating custom exception objects - we can create our own custom `Exception` types!
