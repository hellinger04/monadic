# Revisiting the Project Proposal & Design

<!--
How did the Project Proposal & Design documents help you develop your project?

What changed in your project since you wrote the initial version of those documents?
-->

A lot of the models that we developed in the beginning of the course ended up not being used. We thought that we would
accomplish most of the functionality of the application in the backend, but we actually ended up implementing some of
these features in the frontend, such as the grader, parser, and logic for determing which courses are available to the
user.

# Challenges & Victories

<!--
In software engineering things rarely go as planned: tools don’t work as we expect, deadlines aren’t met, debugging sessions run longer than we hoped for, and so forth.

What were some of the biggest challenges you found when developing your project? How did you overcome them?
-->

One big challenge was learning how to code using JavaScript, React, and JSX. Not many of us were familiar with these 
languages before we began frontend development, yet we had to learn on our feet. 

We had some difficulty meeting the goals and deadlines of some of our iterations, but this made us 1) reconsider which
goals were the most important to us, and 2) work harder to accomplish these tasks in order to meet the deadlines.

# Experience with Tools

<!--
Which tools did you learn to like? Why?

Which tools did you learn to dislike? Why? And what other tools would you have replaced them with if you were to start all over again?
-->

At first, I didn't like JavaScript, React, or JSX, because I found them confusing. Now that I am more familiar with
these tools, I have learned to appreciate them more. 

I never liked Postman that much, and I have always found it confusing. Throughout the course, I never learned to like
Postman, and I probably dislike it as much as I did in the beginning of the course. 

# Iteration 7 & Beyond

<!--
Where would you take your project from here? What features would you add to make your application even more awesome? How would you prioritize that work?

Update the project board with tasks for a hypothetical Iteration 7.
-->

One idea we could implement in Iteration 7 would be a social media component of the project, so that the users would 
have the ability to comment on different lessons and problems to discuss their thoughts on the content. 

Another idea would be to implement a sort of light and dark mode that would change the appearance of the website based
on the time of day. The user could also have the ability to manually change the mode to their preferred setting. 

Finally, we would add more problems and material to the curriculum. There were some exercises that I wanted to implemented but decided against, due to lack of time. In particular, Iteration 7 would re-add TypeScript exercises, which were initially implemented but then removed because we couldn't get the TS compiler to work. Beyond that, we could even add more lessons and courses - there's a lot more to monads, such as monadic laws, transformers, and comonads, and we've only scratched the surface of the surface.

# A Final Message to Your Advisor

<!--
What did you like in working with them?

What do you think they need to improve?

And anything else you’d like to say.
-->

Kalyani was a great advisor - she really helped us put the most essential components of our application into 
perspective, and was a strong guiding force for us.
