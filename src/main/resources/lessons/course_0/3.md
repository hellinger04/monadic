# Lesson 0.3: Fun with immutability

Suppose we want to create a pure functional implementation of the `map` function. First, let's show how *not* to do it. Take a look at this non-functional implementation of the map function:

```javascript
// Okay, it takes in a function as an arg so it’s a higher order
// function. But it requires mutation so it’s not purely functional.
function mapNotFunctional(array, fn) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        let value = array[i];
	array[i] = fn(value);
    }
}
``` 

Immutability has an odd result of making iteration as we know it, such as for and while loops, impossible. In this for loop, we need to mutate our index `i` (in this case by incrementing it). If we don’t mutate it, `i` will be stuck at the same value and your loop will run forever.

It’s even worse with while loops, since while loops check whether some value has met a certain condition; if you can’t change that value, the while loop will either run forever (since it never meets that condition) or not run at all (since it has met that condition at the start of the loop).

Not to mention, in `mapNotFunctional`, we’ve mutated array on the line `array[i] = fn(value)`, so our function is doubly not-functional.

In functional programming languages, you have to use recursion in order to perform iteration. Recursion is when you call a function from within itself. Here is an implementation of `map` that uses recursion instead of iteration:

```javascript
function mapFunctional(fn, list) {
    last = list.last();
    rest = list.pop();
    if (last === undefined) {
        return List();
    } else {
        let newLast = fn(last);
        let newRest = mapFunctional(fn, rest);
        return newRest.push(newLast);
    }
}
```

(Inspired by code from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/implement-array-map-with-recursion-35976d0325b2/)

Here, instead of a default JS array, which is mutable, `mapFunctional` takes in Immutable.js's `List` object as one of its arguments. We split the list into its last element and the rest of the elements (still in `List` form). We check if the last element of the list is undefined, ie. if it doesn’t exist. If that’s the case, we return an new `List` object.

Otherwise, we use take the last value and pass it to `fn`, which returns `newLast`. To create `newRest`, we call `mapFunctional` again, now from inside the body of `mapFunctional`! It may be tricky to wrap your head around this if you’re not used to recursion, but just trace these calls of `mapFunctional` all the way down.

If our list is empty, we return an empty list.

If our list only has a single element in it, `mapFunctional` calls itself on `rest` to create an empty list, and then appends `newLast` to it.

If our list has two elements, `mapFunctional` calls itself to create a one-element list, and then appends `newLast` to it to create a new, two-element list.

Note that throughout this function, we have not mutated a single `List` objects. We’ve only created new lists from old ones. Such is the power of functional programming, recursion, and immutability!

**Problem 0.3.0:** You may have heard of “map-reduce,” and we’ve covered the map part of that. Now we do the reduce part, or at least a variant of reduction called a fold.

```problem
// placeholder text for Problem 0.3.0
function adder(x, y) {
  	return x + y;
}

function foldFunctional(fn, acc, list) {
    // your code here
    // solution added for development purposes
    let last = list[list.length - 1];
  	if (last === undefined) {
    	return acc;
    } else {
  		let result = fn(last, acc);
 		list.pop();
    	return foldFunctional(fn, result, list);
    }
}

// TESTS
// let acc = 0; let list = [1, 2, 3]; foldFunctional(adder, acc, list); ==> 6
// let acc = 0; let list = [-1, -2, -3]; foldFunctional(adder, acc, list); ==> -6
// let acc = -5; let list = [0, 2, 4]; foldFunctional(adder, acc, list); ==> 1
// let acc = 10; let list = [4, 5, 5]; foldFunctional(adder, acc, list); ==> 24
```

Write a function `foldFunctional` that takes in three arguments:

- A two argument function
- An accumulator, which can be of any value (though it has to make sense for the function and the List)
- A `List`

Your `foldFunctional` will run the input function repeatedly over the accumulator and each element of the List, and will return the final value of the accumulator as a result. For example, if `adder` is your function, `0` is your accumulator, and `[1, 2, 3]` is your list, you should end up with the number `6` as your output (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6).

You should not mutate the value of any pre-existing accumulator; you can only create new accumulator instances. You also can't mutate your `List` since it's an Immutable.js object. Furthermore, you should not use for or while loops; use recursion only.

**Problem 0.3.1:** Create a function `filterFunctional` that takes two arguments:

- A predicate, ie. a function that takes in a single argument and returns true or false.
- A `List`

Your `filterFunctional` will run the predicate repeatedly over each element in the list. The output is a new `List` where only elements that make the predicate return `true` exist. For instance, if `greaterThan2` is your predicate and `[1, 3, 2, 5, 7]` is your `List`, then `filterFunctional` should return `[3, 5, 7]`.

Again, you should not mutate the `List`, nor should you use for or while loops.

```problem
// placeholder text for Problem 0.3.1
// do not edit
function greaterThan2(x) {
    if(x > 2) {
      return true;
    }
  	return false;
}

function adder(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

// your code here
function filterFunctional(fn, list) {
    return list;
}

// TESTS
// let arr = [1, 2, 3]; filterFunctional(greaterThan2, arr); ==> 3
// let arr = [3, 6, 10]; filterFunctional(greaterThan2, arr); ==> 3,6,10
// let arr = [-1, 3, 0, 5]; filterFunctional(greaterThan2, arr); ==> 3,5
```
