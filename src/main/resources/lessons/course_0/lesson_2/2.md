Thus, we have a key idea in functional programming: if you call a function, you’ll always get the same result. If you call `adder` on `2` and `3`, you’ll always get `5`. Not `3`, not `7`, not `"fish"`, but `5`. And it will be like that until the end of time. This, along with immutability, is quite useful in avoiding bugs caused by stateful programming.

But wait! Since we clearly don’t want mutable objects or variables like `thing`, how do we create immutable objects in JavaScript? Arent' objects and variables in JavaScript mutable? Yes, which is why immutability can be quite tricky in a language like JavaScript.

The simplest way is programmer discipline - just don’t mutate objects, not even once. Obviously, willpower is nothing if not fickle, so let’s find a better way.

To simulate immutability, we can use `Object.freeze`, which can take in any object and makes it so that mutations aren’t allowed anymore.

```javascript
let foobar = { x = 24 }
Object.freeze(foobar);
foobar.x = 25; // THIS WILL NOT WORK
```

Perhaps the most seamless approach is to use a third-party library to add immutable data structures. For this reason, we have incorporated Immutable.js as a library to add immutable data structures.
