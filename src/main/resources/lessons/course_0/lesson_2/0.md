# Lesson 0.2: Immutability

Here’s an interesting snipped from the map documentation: “map does not mutate the array on which it is called.” This brings us to the next key point of functional programming: *immutability*, or the inability to change data objects after they are created.

In the above case, in functional programming land, you can’t change `arr1` or `arr2` after they have been created. If you wanted to create a new array `arr3`, you’ll have to copy each element from the pre-existing array and then make whatever changes you’d need to make.

(In practice, most functional programming languages are more optimized than this; if you’re creating a new data structure like this, usually they use special “immutable data structures” and don’t copy everything piece by piece.)
