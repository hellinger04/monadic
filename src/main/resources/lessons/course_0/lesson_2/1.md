This might confuse or even surprise you. Why would you want to have immutability? If you can't change data, doesn’t that make programming less powerful? In a sense, yes. But with great power comes great responsibility. Say that you have a class like this:

```javascript
class MyClass {
    thing = 0;
    function addToThing(x) {thing + x};
}
``` 

When you call `addToThing`, what’s the result? If you pass in `2` as an argument, will you get `2`, `3`, `4`, or `116`? It’s impossible to know for sure, since the result depends on what value the variable thing takes at the moment. And if you change (“mutate”) thing between `addToThing` calls, you’ll get different results. If `MyClass` is part of a larger program, where the value of thing may be changed elsewhere, things (no pun intended) can get out of hand really quickly.
