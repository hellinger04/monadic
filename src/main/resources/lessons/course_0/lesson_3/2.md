**Exercise 0.2.0:** You may have heard of “map-reduce,” and we’ve covered the map part of that. Now we do the reduce part, or at least a variant of reduction called a fold.

Write a function `foldFunctional` that takes in three arguments:

- A two argument function
- An accumulator, which can be of any value (though it has to make sense for the function and the List)
- A `List`

Your `foldFunctional` will run the input function repeatedly over the accumulator and each element of the List, and will return the final value of the accumulator as a result. For example, if `adder` is your function, `0` is your accumulator, and `[1, 2, 3]` is your list, you should end up with the number `6` as your output (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6).

You should not mutate the value of any pre-existing accumulator; you can only create new accumulator instances. You also can't mutate your `List` since it's an Immutable.js object. Furthermore, you should not use for or while loops; use recursion only.
