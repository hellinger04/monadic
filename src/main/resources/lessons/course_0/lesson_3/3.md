**Exercise 0.2.1:** Create a function `filterFunctional` that takes two arguments:

- A predicate, ie. a function that takes in a single argument and returns true or false.
- A `List`

Your `filterFunctional` will run the predicate repeatedly over each element in the list. The output is a new `List` where only elements that make the predicate return `true` exist. For instance, if `greaterThan2` is your predicate and `[1, 3, 2, 5, 7]` is your `List`, then `filterFunctional` should return `[3, 5, 7]`.

Again, you should not mutate the `List`, nor should you use for or while loops.
