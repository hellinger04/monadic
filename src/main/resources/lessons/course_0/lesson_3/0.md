# Lesson 0.3: Fun with immutability

Suppose we want to create a pure functional implementation of the `map` function. First, let's show how *not* to do it. Take a look at this non-functional implementation of the map function:

```javascript
// Okay, it takes in a function as an arg so it’s a higher order
// function. But it requires mutation so it’s not purely functional.
function mapNotFunctional(array, fn) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        let value = array[i];
	array[i] = fn(value);
    }
}
``` 

Immutability has an odd result of making iteration as we know it, such as for and while loops, impossible. In this for loop, we need to mutate our index `i` (in this case by incrementing it). If we don’t mutate it, `i` will be stuck at the same value and your loop will run forever.

It’s even worse with while loops, since while loops check whether some value has met a certain condition; if you can’t change that value, the while loop will either run forever (since it never meets that condition) or not run at all (since it has met that condition at the start of the loop).

Not to mention, in `mapNotFunctional`, we’ve mutated array on the line `array[i] = fn(value)`, so our function is doubly not-functional.
