Ok, let’s move on.

Functional programming is a distinct programming paradigm (basically a way to do programming). You may have heard of some functional programming languages like Haskell, OCaml, and Lisp. No? Ok, many of these languages are pretty obscure compared to the more commonly used ones (which is why we’re not using them for most of our tutorial). But they are relatively popular within the functional programming community, so here’s an overview of the popular families:

- Haskell: Named after the mathematician Haskell Curry, it was first released in 1990 for academia. it’s now used in industry, including by Facebook of all things. Haskell is a prime example of a “pure” functional programming language, ie. a language without any non-functional features.

- OCaml: Part of the larger ML family of languages, it first appeared in 1996. It’s best-known use is by the finance company Jane Street.

- Lisp: This is actually a family of languages, not a single language; its most popular members are Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure. The family first appeared in 1958. All Lisps share the fact that their syntax are dominated by parentheses (like (this)).

Just for fun, here’s how you write a simple `adder` function in some functional programming languages:

OCaml:
```ocaml
let adder x y = x + y;;
```

Clojure (a Lisp):
```clojure
(defn adder [x y] (+ x y))
```
