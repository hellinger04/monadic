But even some of the most commonly used languages in the world, including JavaScript and Python, have functional programming elements. Even Java and C++ have gotten in on the game by including some functional programming.

Here’s how some functional programming features have been implemented in these four popular languages.

- Functions: Technically all of them have functions, though Java calls them “methods” and doesn’t allow them outside of classes.

- Immutable data: Some built-in data types are immutable by default, such as Strings in Java and tuples in Python.

- Higher order functions: In JS and Python since forever, and in C++ using `std::function`.

- Anonymous functions: In JS and Python since forever, in C++ since C++11, and in Java since Java 8.

- Partial function application: In Python using `partial`, in JS using the `bind` function, and C++ using `std::bind`.

Do some of these words not make sense? That’s great! We’ll be learning about these concepts in the next few lessons, through the medium of JavaScript.
