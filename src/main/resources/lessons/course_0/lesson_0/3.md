*But wait.* Before we move on, we need to make a few modifications to JavaScript to make functional programming a bit easier.

- TypeScript vs. JavaScript: TypeScript is simply JavaScript with types. Where before all we had were vars and lets, now we have actual types like number and string. This will be important for monadic programming, since monads heavily incorporate types.

- Immutable.js: This is a library developed by Facebook that allows us to use immutable objects, which we explain in Lesson 0.2.

All of these modifications have been made by us already, so you donâ€™t have to worry about them.
