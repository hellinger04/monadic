# Lesson 0.0: Intro to Functional Programming

Monads are a *functional programming* concept, so before we even touch monads we need to have a solid understanding of what the heck functional programming is.

First, you know what programming is, with or without the functional part, right? In particular, our tutorial will be using JavaScript and TypeScript throughout, so if you don’t have a good grasp of these languages, we suggest that you learn them. There are plenty of resources on the Internets that can teach you better than we can, so we suggest using Google.

You learned how to do JavaScript? Good? Let's check.

**Problem 0.0.0:** Let’s check that you have a modicum of JavaScript knowledge. Write in JavaScript a function called `adder` that adds two numbers together. We will be using this function in the next lesson.

```problem
///// CODE
function adder(x, y) {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

///// TESTS
adder(2, 3) ==> 5
adder(100, -100) ==> 0
adder("Foo", "Bar") ==> "FooBar"

///// LANGUAGE
JavaScript
```

Ok, let’s move on.

Functional programming is a distinct programming paradigm (basically a way to do programming). You may have heard of some functional programming languages like Haskell, OCaml, and Lisp. No? Ok, many of these languages are pretty obscure compared to the more commonly used ones (which is why we’re not using them for most of our tutorial). But they are relatively popular within the functional programming community, so here’s an overview of the popular families:

- Haskell: Named after the mathematician Haskell Curry, it was first released in 1990 for academia. it’s now used in industry, including by Facebook of all things. Haskell is a prime example of a “pure” functional programming language, ie. a language without any non-functional features.

- OCaml: Part of the larger ML family of languages, it first appeared in 1996. Its best-known use is by the finance company Jane Street.

- Lisp: This is actually a family of languages, not a single language; its most popular members are Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure. The family first appeared in 1958. All Lisps share the fact that their syntax are dominated by parentheses (like (this)).

Just for fun, here’s how you write a simple `adder` function in some functional programming languages:

OCaml:
```ocaml
let adder x y = x + y;;
```

Clojure (a Lisp):
```clojure
(defn adder [x y] (+ x y))
```

But even some of the most commonly used languages in the world, including JavaScript and Python, have functional programming elements. Even Java and C++ have gotten in on the game by including some functional programming.

Here’s how some functional programming features have been implemented in these four popular languages.

- Functions: Technically all of them have functions, though Java calls them “methods” and doesn’t allow them outside of classes.

- Immutable data: Some built-in data types are immutable by default, such as Strings in Java and tuples in Python.

- Higher order functions: In JS and Python since forever, and in C++ using `std::function`.

- Anonymous functions: In JS and Python since forever, in C++ since C++11, and in Java since Java 8.

- Partial function application: In Python using `partial`, in JS using the `bind` function, and C++ using `std::bind`.

Do some of these words not make sense? That’s great! We’ll be learning about these concepts in the next few lessons, through the medium of JavaScript.

But wait. Before we move on, we need to talk about JavaScript's evil twin: TypeScript. Which is just JavaScript with types. For example, the following code in JavaScript:

```javascript
function addQuestionMark(str) {
  return str + "?";
}
```

is equivalent to the following code in TypeScript:

```typescript
function addQuestionMark(str: string): string {
  return str + "?";
}
```

Well, almost equivalent. While you can get away with passing an integer to the JavaScript version of `addQuestionMark` (since in JS you can get away with anything), in the TypeScript version you will get an error.

On this website, some code examples and problems will be in JavaScript, and some will be in TypeScript. It's easy to tell the difference - if there's types, you have TypeScript.

**Problem 0.0.1:** Rewrite your `adder` function in TypeScript. Make sure it only takes in numbers as arguments, and that it returns a number.

```problem
///// CODE
function adder(x: ???, y: ???): ??? {
  // TODO: Your code here
  // solution added for development purposes
  return x + y;
}

///// TESTS
adder(2, 3) ==> 5
adder(100, -100) ==> 0
adder("Foo", "Bar") ==> "FooBar"

///// LANGUAGE
TypeScript
```
