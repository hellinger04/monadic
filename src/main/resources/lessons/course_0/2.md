# Lesson 0.2: Immutability

Here’s an interesting snipped from the map documentation: “map does not mutate the array on which it is called.” This brings us to the next key point of functional programming: *immutability*, or the inability to change data objects after they are created.

In the above case, in functional programming land, you can’t change `arr1` or `arr2` after they have been created. If you wanted to add a new element in `arr1`, you’ll have to make an `arr3` and copy each element from the `arr1` array, and then add the new element.

This might confuse or even surprise you. Why would you want to have immutability? If you can't change data, doesn’t that make programming less powerful? In a sense, yes. But with great power comes great responsibility. Say that you have a class like this:

```javascript
class MyClass {
    thing = 0;
    function addToThing(x) {thing + x};
}
```

When you call `addToThing`, what’s the result? If you pass in `2` as an argument, will you get `2`, `3`, `4`, or `116`? It’s impossible to know for sure, since the result depends on what value the variable thing takes at the moment. And if you change (“mutate”) `thing` between `addToThing` calls, you’ll get different results. If `MyClass` is part of a larger program, where the value of thing may be changed elsewhere, things (no pun intended) can get out of hand really quickly. Say `thing` was 6. Then, something else in the program (or outside of the program, like say, `thing` is a status register) changes `thing` to 7. It was mutated. 

Thus, we have a key idea in functional programming: if you call a function, you’ll always get the same result. If you call `adder` on `2` and `3`, you’ll always get `5`. Not `3`, not `7`, not `"fish"`, but `5`. And it will be like that until the end of time. You will be in your grave and it will be the same. Your bones will become fossils and it will still be the same. This, along with immutability, is quite useful in avoiding bugs caused by stateful programming.

But wait! Since we clearly don’t want mutable objects or variables like `thing`, how do we create immutable objects in JavaScript? Arent' objects and variables in JavaScript mutable? Yes, which is why immutability can be quite tricky in a language like JavaScript.

The simplest way is programmer discipline - just don’t mutate objects, not even once. Obviously, willpower is nothing if not fickle, so let’s find a better way.

To simulate immutability, we can use `Object.freeze`, which can take in any object and makes it so that mutations aren’t allowed anymore.

```javascript
let foobar = { x = 24 }
Object.freeze(foobar);
foobar.x = 25; // THIS WILL NOT WORK
```

Perhaps the most seamless approach is to use a third-party library to add immutable data structures. For this reason, we have incorporated Immutable.js as a library to add immutable data structures.

Also, since mutable objects like `thing` are a thing (again, no pun intended) in JS, does that mean that JS isn’t functional? That’s true, sort of. JavaScript and Python have functional programming concepts built into them, but since you can do non-functional programming in them as well, they’re not *pure* functional programming languages. If they were pure functional, everyone would be using monads, because that's what you do when you're in a pure functional label in you find yourself in the entirely predictable situation of wanting to have some state.

In a pure functional language like Haskell, any mutations and other non-functional stuff are prohibited. But in JavaScript, you can choose when to use functional programming and when not to, making it very flexible (some would say too flexible). In fact, Haskell is somewhat unusual in being a pure functional language. Most functional programming languages, such as OCaml and Clojure, have ways to implement non-functional stuff (though the non-functional stuff is less emphasized than in JS or Python), making them non-pure functional as well.

Anyways, back to immutable data structures. You might be wondering how you can do things without mutating objects. The key is that even though you can’t mutate existing variables or objects, you can create new data using immutable data. Take a look at this code:

```javascript
// List is an immutable object from Immutable.js
const list1 = List([1, 2, 3]);
const list2 = list1.map(x => x * 2);
// Expected result: list2 = [2, 4, 6]
```

As said before, `map` doesn’t mutate the array that it’s called on. Instead, it creates a new array out of the old one, and applies the function specified to every element in the list. Now we have two objects, `list1` and `list2`, running around. The `List` object is the same as it was before, as it is an immutable data structure.
