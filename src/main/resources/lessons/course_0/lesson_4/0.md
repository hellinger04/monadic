# Lesson 0.4: Side Effects

Mutations are an example of *side effects*. What are side effects? They're whatever a function outputs that's not its return value. For example:

```javascript
function adderWithSideEffects(x, y) {
     let sum = x + y;
     console.log(sum);
     return sum;
}
```

The return value is `sum`, while printing `sum` to the console is a side effect.
