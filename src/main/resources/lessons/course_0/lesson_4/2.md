Pure functions are awesome. Despite the limitations of not having side effects like mutation or printing, you can still do crazy things with pure functions, such as creating new (immutable) objects like there’s no tomorrow or calculating the trillionth digit of pi. At the same time, you often want to avoid side effects, since they can do stuff like mutate variables or interrupt program flow.

And sometimes, like when you’re programming in Haskell, you can’t have side effects because your whole damn language is pure functional.

Still, sometimes you want impure functions, like if you're printing to the console or command line. Pure functions aren't always better than impure ones. As with anything in software engineering, there are decisions to be made. Sometimes an impure function should be chosen over a pure one, or vice versa.

So how do you get the best of both worlds? That is where monads come in.

<!--TODO: Hanna Montana graphic from the early 2000's-->

Monads allow you to have a space in your program where you can do all the side effects you want, and then come back to pure functional land once you’re done messing around with them. In other words, they allow you to encapsulate your side effects. In fact, the way Haskell does I/O is through a monad!

Motivated enough? We hope so, so why not jump right into Monadland?
