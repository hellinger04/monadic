# Lesson 0.1: The "functional" of functional programming

Functional programming is defined by two key concepts:

- Programs are built out of functions, the same kind you learned in middle-school math. You know, f(x) = y.

- Data structures (arrays, maps, etc.) are *immutable*, meaning that you cannot change (“mutate”) their state.

In this lesson, let’s just focus on the first key point. Remember the `adder` function that you wrote in JavaScript?

```javascript
function adder(x, y) { return x + y; }
```

That’s functional programming for you! You have your `adder` function, which takes two arguments as input and spits out an output, in this case the sum.

What can you do with these programs? Well, you can pass in the outputs of one program as the inputs of another.

```javascript
function adder(x, y) { return x + y; }
function mult2(z) {return z * 2; }

let sum = adder(2, 3);
let result = mult2(sum);

// Expected output: result = 10
```

The result will be `10` when it’s all said and done.
