# Lesson 2.2: Making monads from things you already know 

Now you know about functions and functional programming. The main idea of
functional programming is that functions are the same as data, and we can treat
them the same way. Just as easily as we can pass a function an int, a string, or
any other type, we can pass a function another function.

TODO higher order functions

You already know about functions, so we are almost there.

Next, we're going to talk about monoids. Don't wimp out from hearing that word.
It's really very simple. All a monoid is is a function that goes from some
type, to that same type.

I know you know javascript, but maybe you know python, too. Have you noticed in
python 3 that you can say 

```python
def soFun(self, s: str) -> str:
    return s
```

This is a function, from string to string. That's all a monoid is. Python 3 is
saying it that way because it's trying to be functional. It is asserting s is of
type string, and that the function returns a string. 

This can count for any type. Let's say we have a generic type, which you
probably know about. Let's call the generic type AnythingAtAll. So we could do
this:

```python
def Don'tBeAfraid(self, a: AnythingAtAll) -> AnythingAtAll:
    return a
```

It's very simple and I know you are still following. That's all a monoid is. Now
you know. Unclear what is so scary about this. A monoid is not Beetlejuice.
Nobody comes to get you if you say it three times. Make your own monoid in
Javascript.
