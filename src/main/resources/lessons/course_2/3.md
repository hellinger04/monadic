# Lesson 2.3: The concept of monad 

So the difference between a monad and a monoid is the monad takes a value of
AnythingAtAll type and returns a value of AnythingAtAll type.

A monad returns a transform of AnythingAtAll type.

So we have:

```javascript
FunFunction: AnythingAtAll -> Transform(AnythingAtAll)
GreatFunction: AnythingAtAll -> Transform(AnythingAtAll)
```

and as long as Transform does the same thing in every function, we are still in
the land of function composition and still have that fantastic associative
property. 

Alright, let's get all the way there. There's a thing called lambda notation
that uses the little lambda symbol. 

TODO: replace with lambda symbol
lambda -> 

In JavaScript, that's like

```javascript
a => 
```

Lambda means the same thing in math. We write this as: lambda a -> (FunFunction a).bind(lambda a (GreatFunction a)). In
JavaScript, we write this statement as:

```javascript
a => (FunFunction(a).bind(a => GreatFunction(a))
```

So the lambda is just saying it's a function, more or less.

So look back to what FunFunction takes and returns. It takes AnythingAtAll, and
returns a Transform(AnythingAtAll). GreatFunction takes AnythingAtAll and
returns Transform(AnythingAtAll). Since the right side and the left side do the
same thing, we stay in the land of function composition and retain the
associative property.
