# Lesson 2.1: Function composition 

As long as we have two function, and they each take our type, AnythingAtAll, nd
they both return AnythingAtAll, we can group them in any order. That's function
composition

FunFunction: AnythingAtAll -> AnythingAtAll 
GreatFunction: AnythingAtAll -> AnythingAtAll

We have a composition operator, which is a little open dot. It kind of looks
like multiplication, because it's kind of like multiplication. Here's our little
dot: °

In JavaScript, we can do function composition like this:

```javascript
var a \\a is of type AnythingAtAll
FunFunction(GreatFunction(a))
```

And we know this is ok, because GreatFunction will take this a, do whatever it
does (it doesn't matter what it does) and give back an a, a variable of type
AnythingAtAll. That's great because that's what FunFunction takes. So
FunFunction takes that a, and gives back another a. Since they both take
AnythingAtAll, we're cool.

We can use the compositional operator instead to mean the same thing.
(FunFunction ° GreatFunction)(a) means the same thing as
(FunFunction(GreatFunction(a))

Let's take it back to 3rd grade math. Multiplication is associative. That means
6 * ( 2 * 1 ) is the same as ( 6 * 2 ) * 1

Note: ( 2 * 6 ) * 1 is changing the order, that's a different property.
Associative is just about grouping.

Let's view. Say we have 3 strings. We are going to show concat has the
associative property. Remember: Associative means we can change grouping, not
order.

Let's concat.

```javascript
concat("hello ", concat("cruel ", "world"))
```

This is the same as

```javascript
concat(concat("hello ", "cruel "), "world")
```

It's the same either way. The nice thing about this property is for parallel
computing or distributed systems. We don't have to worry about shared state. Say
we have a bunch of things, and we want to send them off to different cores or
different nodes in a distributed system to run. We can send them in arbitrary
groupings, and there is not shared memory or shared state. When they get back,
we can go ahead and combine the results of the groupings as they return with the
ones next to them. As long as we keep order, how we group them doesn't matter.

Imagine one million concats. We send them all off, in arbitrary groupings,
to whatever node has processing power. When groups return, we can combine any
group that is next to each other as soon as they both come back. It doesn't
matter the order. So this reduces complexity a lot, to have this associative
property, and we have a lot less to worry about.
