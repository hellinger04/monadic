# Lesson 2.1: Function composition 

As long as we have two functions, each of which take and return our type AnythingAtAll, we can group them in any order. 
That's function composition.

```javascript
FunFunction: AnythingAtAll -> AnythingAtAll
GreatFunction: AnythingAtAll -> AnythingAtAll
```

We have a composition operator, which is a little open dot. It kind of looks
like multiplication, because it's kind of like multiplication. Here's our little
dot: °

In JavaScript, we can do function composition like this:

```javascript
var a \\type is AnythingAtAll
FunFunction(GreatFunction(a))
```

And we know this is ok, because GreatFunction will take this a, do whatever it
does (it doesn't matter what it does) and give back an a, a variable of type
AnythingAtAll. That's great because that's what FunFunction takes. So
FunFunction takes that a, and gives back another a. Since they both take
AnythingAtAll, we're cool.

We can use the compositional operator instead to mean the same thing. Following the example above, 
(FunFunction ° GreatFunction)(a) means the same thing as FunFunction(GreatFunction(a)).

Let's take it back to 3rd grade math. Multiplication is associative. That means 6 * ( 2 * 1 ) is the same as 
( 6 * 2 ) * 1. Note: ( 2 * 6 ) * 1 is changing the order, that's a different property. Associative is just about grouping.

We are going to show that concatenation is associative. Say we concatenate three strings:

```javascript
concat("hello ", concat("cruel ", "world"))
```

We get the same result if we change the grouping:

```javascript
concat(concat("hello ", "cruel "), "world")
```

In parallel computing or distributed systems, this property lets us ignore shared state. Say we have a bunch of things, 
and we want to send them off to different cores or different nodes in a distributed system to run. We can send them in 
arbitrary groupings, and there is not shared memory or shared state. When they get back, we can go ahead and combine the 
results of the groupings as they return with the ones next to them. As long as we keep order, how we group them doesn't 
matter.

Imagine one million concatenation operations. We send them all off, in arbitrary groupings, to whatever node has 
processing power. When groups return, we can combine any group that is next to each other as soon as they both come 
back. It doesn't matter the order. So this reduces complexity a lot, to have this associative property, and we have a 
lot less to worry about.
