# Lesson 2.4: Pulling back the green curtain 

Let's make a general monad so we can get the basic idea about the point. You're going to make a monad from nothing. 

```problem
function excitedHelloWorld(x) {
    //concat as many exclamation points as you want
    //to x, which will be hello world in this case
    //decide on the amount by how excited you are to
    //be in the world, and return the new string
}

function tellASecret(x) {
  //concat a string that contains a secret you have
  //to whatever x is and return the new string
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    //concat a string with the best gossip you know
    //to x and return the new string
}

function run() {
    x = "Hello World"
    x = excitedHelloWorld(x);
    x = tellASecret(x);
    x = bestGossip(x);
}

console.log(run());

// TESTS
```

This is the type of program you are used to and there shouldn't be any
surprises. You can see in the console, you say hello to the world, you see the
secret you told and then you can read the best gossip you know. 

Now, add a function called "wrapper". It should just return x. Then, make a
function called applyFunc that applies the function to the x that you just
wrapped.

```problem
function excitedHelloWorld(x) {
    //concat as many exclamation points as you want
    //to x, which will be hello world in this case
    //decide on the amount by how excited you are to
    //be in the world, and return the new string
}

function tellASecret(x) {
  //concat a string that contains a secret you have
  //to whatever x is and return the new string
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    //concat a string with the best gossip you know
    //to x and return the new string
}

function wrapper(x) {
    //wrap it!
}

function applyFunc(x, func) {
    //apply the func to the x!
}

function run() {
    x = "Hello World"
    x = wrapper(x)
    x = applyFunc(x, excitedHelloWorld);
    x = applyFunc(x, tellASecret);
    x = applyFunc(x, bestGossip);
}

console.log(run());


// Dev notes: add test checking for use of Error object?

// TESTS
```

This program does the same thing as the last one, but now instead of calling
your functions directly, you pass them to a function that does it for you.
That's a higher order function, because you give the function a function. 

You can see, this is the same program as before. Instead of calling the
functions directly, we give them to applyFunc to call them with whatever we want
as a parameter.

At this point...you already have a monad!
