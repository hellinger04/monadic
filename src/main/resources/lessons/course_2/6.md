# Lesson 2.6: Wrapping things up

Horray! We have a monad! We have `ret`, `bind`, and monadic types...except not really. Because `Value` and `Error` are not really types; they're just the name of classes. To introduce actual types, we need to use TypeScript.

Let's take a look at what we have from our last exercise:

```javascript
class Exn {
  constructor(msg) { this.message = msg; }
}

class Value {
  constructor(x) { this.x = x; }
}

function ret(x) {
  return new Value(x);
}

// This wasn't in the exercise, but it's still important
function bind(m, fn) {
  if (m instanceof Exn) {
    return m;
  } else if (m instanceof Value) {
    return fn(m.x);
  }
}

function raise(msg) {
  return new Exn(msg);
}

function tryWith(m, fn) {
  if (m instanceof Exn) {
    return fn(m.message);
  } else if (m instanceof Value) {
    return m;
  }
}
```

How can we translate this into TypeScript? First, we can replace our wrapper classes with TypeScript interfaces, which are commonly used to represent "wrapper" types. To replace our `Value`, we can implement a TypeScript interface `V`.

```typescript
interface V {
  value: any
}
```

Our interface `V` contains a single field `value` that can be of `any` type. Which means that `value` can be of any type. Seriously! `any` is a type in TypeScript that allows a value to be anything, such as a `string`, a `number`, etc.

Sometimes, that's not what we want (or else what's the point of typechecking?) But we don't want to have `value` have type `string`, `number`, etc. either, since that's obviously too restrictive. Instead, we use _generics_ to find a middle ground between `value` having a specific type and basically not having a type at all:

```typescript
interface V<A> {
  value: A
}
```

Now we can say stuff like `fun(m: V<A>): V<B>`, such as if we want a function that, for instance takes a `V` that wraps a `number` into one that wraps a `string`.

We also want a wrapper that wraps our exceptions. We can create a similar interface `E` that wraps an `string` object (unlike the `value` in `V`, our error messages can only be strings).

```typescript
interface E {
  exception: string 
}
```

Now that we have two interfaces, `V<A>` and `E`, we can combine them into a single type. If we stuck to JavaScript, we could use inheritance to describe a `Monadic` superclass. But in TypeScript, we can create our monadic type in a far more concise manner, as so:

```typescript
type EMon<A> = V<A> | E
```

Our monadic type `EMon` is an example of a _union type_, which can be read as "`EMon<A>` can be a `V<A>` _or_ a `E`. Note that `EMon` also needs to take a generic parameter, because it can represent an object of type `V<A>`.

We can go further by creating a _discriminated union type_. To do so, we add another field in our interface (conventionally called `kind`) that allows us to distinguish (ie. discriminate) between `V<A>` and `E` in `switch` statements:

```typescript
interface V<A> {
  kind: "value",
  value: A
}

interface E {
  kind: "exception",
  exception: Error
}
```

Now, instead of a clumsy `if` statement, we can use `switch` statements to match on our `EMon` type in `bind`:

```typescript
function bind<A, B>(m: EMon<A>, fn: (a: A) => EMon<B>): EMon<B> {
  switch(m.kind) { // match on the kind parameter
    case "exception":
      return m;
    case "value":
      return fn(m.value);
  }
}
```

Note that in addition to replacing `if` with `switch`, we have a bunch of type-related stuff in the function definition, because TypeScript. While it looks confusing, it's actually helpful in telling us what `bind` is supposed to take in as arguments and what `bind` is supposed to return:

- `bind<A, B>`: The generic arguments tell us that we have two different generic types, `A` and `B`, involved with `bind.`
- `m: EMon<A>`: `bind`'s first argument is of a monadic type (which may wrap a value of type `A`).
- `fn: (a: A) => EMon<B>`: `bind`'s second argument is a function that takes in a regular value (_not_ a monadic one - we don't want it to take in an `E`!) and returns a monadic value, which may be of a different type from `m`.
- `EMon<B>`: `bind`'s return value is of the monadic type. It's either `m` itself (if `m` is an `E`) or the return value of `fn(m.value)`.

**Problem 1.6.0:** Change `ret` to return a `V<A>` instead of a `Value`. Hint: Now that we're in TypeScript land, pay attention to the function definition.

```problem
interface V<A> { kind: "value", value: A }
interface E { kind: "exception", exception: Error }
type EMon<A> = V<A> | E;

function ret<A>(x: A): EMon<A> {
  // Your code here
}

// TESTS
ret<number>(2).kind ==> value
```

**Problem 1.6.1:** Change `raise` to return a `E` instead of an `Exn`. Hint: you're still wrapping `string`s.

```problem
interface V<A> { kind: "value", value: A }
interface E { kind: "exception", exception: Error }
type EMon<A> = V<A> | E;

function raise<A>(x: string): EMon<A> {
  // Your code here
}

// TESTS
raise<number>("Uh oh").kind ==> exception
```

**Problem 1.6.2:** Change `tryWith` to conform to the new TypeScript types. Hint: Think how `bind`'s internal logic works, and look at `tryWith`'s types.

```problem
interface V<A> { kind: "value", value: A }
interface E { kind: "exception", exception: Error }
type EMon<A> = V<A> | E;

function ret<A>(x: A): EMon<A> {
  // Copy-paste your solution from Problem 1.6.0 
}

function raise<A>(x: string): EMon<A> {
  // Copy-paste your solution from Problem 1.6.1
}

function tryWith<A>(m: EMon<A>, f: (e: string) => EMon<A>): EMon<A> {
  // Your code here
}

// TESTS
tryWith<number>(ret<number>(2), msg => ret<number>(3)).kind ===> value
tryWith<number>(raise<number>("Uh oh"), msg => ret<number>(3)).kind ==> exception
```

**Problem 1.6.3:** While not strictly required, a lot of monads have a `run` operation to exit the monad back into pure function land. Write `run` to take a `EMon` argument, "unwrap" it, and return the underlying value.

Hint: It's rather tricky to determine what `run` should do if the `EMon` argument is of type `E`, ie. if it is an uncaught exception. Because of this, we introduce a new union type `Result<A>` to cover all cases.

```problem
interface V<A> { kind: "value", value: A }
interface E { kind: "exception", exception: Error }
type EMon<A> = V<A> | E;

function ret<A>(x: A): EMon<A> {
  // Copy-paste your solution from Problem 1.6.0 
}

function raise<A>(x: string): EMon<A> {
  // Copy-paste your solution from Problem 1.6.1
}

function tryWith<A>(m: EMon<A>, f: (e: string) => EMon<A>): EMon<A> {
  // Copy-paste your solution from Problem 1.6.2
}

type Result<A> = A | string; // Pay attention to this

function run<A>(m: EMon<A>): Result<A> {
  // Your code here
}
// TESTS
run<number>(ret<number>(2)) ==> 2
run<number>(raise<number>("Uh oh!")) ==> Uh oh!
```
