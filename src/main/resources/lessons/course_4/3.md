#Lesson 4.3: Async/await

You probably have used async/await in Javascript - and it does a lot of magic.  Sometimes, when something is doing magic, it makes it harder to use because you don't have any intuition about what's going on. When I first learned about recursion, I couldn't figure out how to use it or why it was doing what it was doing. Thankfully, someone thought to explain the stack to me. Then I could imagine that the call stack was my stack and what I was putting on it and popping off it. Then recursion was easy.

We're going to look under the hood of async/await and understand what it's _really_ doing.

async/await lets you start a function, then continue on in your main thread while the function does its thing in the background. It lets you do fake concurrency without the complexity of threads. Usually it's used when you need to wait for a task that takes a long time, such as waiting for a remote machine or retrieving something from a database. Without async/await, we have to wait for everything start, then finish, then start, then finish one after each other, which will lead to spinning beach balls of death every time you open a browser.

Here's an example of async/await:

```javascript
async handleClick() {
  await fetch("/items", { method: "POST" });
}
```

`handleClick` is called when a user clicks on a button. When they click on a button, it makes a `POST` request to the server, which queries a database, and asks for all the items in the database. (If you don't know what `POST` means, don't worry.  `POST` is just is telling the server some information)

The `async` keyword marks the function as having the `await` keyword in the function body. If a function uses the `await` keyword without being marked `async`, you will get a syntax error.

Then in the function, the code basically does what you think it would do if you read it as a sentence: we wait for the server to fetch the items using the `POST` request.

While we wait for `fetch` to finish, because it's marked with `await` in front, our thread can go do other things. When `fetch` returns, then we deal with the information it returned to us. If `await` was not used, the browser will have to wait for `fetch` to return before it does anything else, causing it to freeze and the user to become very angry.

Now here's a fact about async/await: it's just syntactic sugar! When the browser compiles your JavaScript, it gets rid of async/await and replaces it with lower-level code that does the same thing. (This is in part because async/await is a relatively new feature, so compilers replace it with what was used in older versions of JS so that old and new code work in exactly the same way.)

Now, we will show you what the compiler turns into async/await into!!! This seems like magic, but in reality, it's even better. It's continuations!

```javascript
async function foo() {
    let res = await(wixData.get(args));
    let item = res;
    item.awake = true;
}
```


```javascript
    // Goodbye async await!!!
    function callcc(func) {
        return function(cont) {
            return (func(cont))(cont)
        }
    }

    function throw(cont, x) {
        return function(cont1) {
            return cont(x);
        }
    }

    function useData() {
        return bind(callcc(cont => {
            wixData.getData(args).then(res1 => {
                throw(cont, res1);
            });
        }),
        res => {
            let item = res;
            item.awake = true;
            return ret(item.awake);
        });
    }
```

Let's start by explaining `useData`. So, we have to give `bind` the two things
it needs: the monadic value and the function. `callcc` gives back a wrapped
monadic value, and bind will unwrap that data. Remember, `bind` is always
`bind(mon, func)`. `callcc` is the continuation taking function, and the
continuation is the rest of the work.

`res1` is the work that is already done at the point in time that `then` was
called. Then, `res1` is applied to `cont`. So, `res1` replaces the work that was
already done. `res1` captures the work that was already done after `useData`.

If you're using async/await, you have a different "work that you've already"
done, than if you had ignored everything else, had a beachball of death, and
just waited for the result to come back without doing anything else in the
meantime.
