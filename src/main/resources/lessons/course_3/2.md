# Lesson 3.2: Writer monad

Counting is super fun, but with some modifications to the Counter monad we can do more than just counting. For instance, wouldn't it fun to do IO? (In fact, if you're doing Haskell, it's mandatory fun - you need to use a IO monad to do any IO whatsoever).

For simplicity's sake, let's focus on the "O" part of "IO" - printing output. For example, any JS programmer would've seen this a gazillion times:

```javascript
console.log("Hello world!");
```

A common use for `console.log` is logging messages to output. (I mean, it's called `console.log` for a reason!) So how can we make a Logger monad?

Let's take inspiration from the Counter monad. The Counter monad starts with an initial count (usually zero) and accumulates increments (or decrements) as the monad runs. Then in the end, we get back a final count. Similarly, we could use a list of messages in the Logger monad. We start out with no messages, accumulate messages as we go along in our monad, and print out all the messages in the end. Here's our `run` method based on our idea:

```javascript
function run(mon) {
  // Start with an empty list and get back a log list
  let [x, logs] = mon([]);

  // Side effect time! Print each log to the console
  logs.map(console.log);

  // Return the value
  return x;
}
```

If you want to see what's being printed this way, you'll have to go to your browser's console (in Google Chrome, it's More Tools > Developer Tools > Console under the browser menu). If you don't want to feel like a hacker, though, there's another way - create a window popup to show all the logs:

```javascript
function run(mon) {
  // Start with an empty list (like before)
  let [x, logs] = mon([]);

  // Create a giant string of all the logs
  let logStr = logs.join("\n");

  // Side effect time! Display the logs to the console
  window.alert(logStr);

  // Return the value
  return x;
}
```

So that's the actual IO part done. But how do we actually create our list of logs?

**Problem 3.2.0:** Rework the Counter monad to become a Logger monad: instead of passing around a single number, we pass around a list of strings that we add to. We've already shown you how `run` needs to be modified. But now, you have to modify `ret` and `bind`. In addition, there's a new operation `log` that you need to fill in.

- Hint 1: There is surprisingly little you need to change in `ret` and `bind` from the Counter monad.

- Hint 2: All operations here (except for `run`) return functions that take in a list of logs as an argument (just like how in the Counter monad, all operations return functions that accept `count` as their argument). `log` is no exception. In fact, the process of actually adding a new log happens in the function `log` returns.

- Hint 3: Because `log` is only supposed to act on the logs, not the main value, let `log`'s function return `[null, newLog]`.

```problem
///// CODE
function ret(a) {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

function bind(mon, func) {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

function log(msg) {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

function run(mon) {
  let [x, logs] = mon([]);
  let logStr = logs.join("\n");
  window.alert(logStr);
  return x;
}

///// SOLUTION
function ret(a) {
  return function(logs) {
    return [a, logs];
  }
}

function bind(mon, func) {
  return function(logs) {
    let [x, logs1] = mon(logs);
    return func(x)(logs1);
  }
}

function log(msg) {
  return function(logs) {
    return [null, [...logs, msg]];
  }
}

function run(mon) {
  let [x, logs] = mon([]);
  let logStr = logs.join("\n");
  window.alert(logStr);
  return x;
}

///// TESTS
typeof ret(2); ==> "function"
typeof bind(ret(0), _ => ret(1)); ==> "function"
ret(2)([]) ==> [2,[]]
bind(ret(1), x => log("foo"))([]) ==> [null,["foo"]]
bind(ret(2), x => bind(log("foo"), _ => ret(x)))([]) ==> [2,["foo"]]
bind(ret(2), x => bind(log("foo"), _ => bind(log("bar"), _ => ret(x))))([]) ==> [2,["foo","bar"]]
run(bind(ret(2), x => bind(log("foo"), _ => bind(log("bar"), _ => ret(x))))) ==> 2

**Problem 3.2.1:** Let's go back to the Fibonacci function. If you've noticed, the number of function calls blows up dramatically for bigger and bigger `n`. Now let's get a visceral sense of that. Use our Logger monad to log each `n` that was called, in order.

- Hint: This should be similar to what you did with the Counter monad.

```problem
///// CODE
function ret(a) {
  // TODO: Copy-paste you code from above 
}

function bind(mon, func) {
  // TODO: Copy-paste you code from above 
}

function log(msg) {
  // TODO: Copy-paste you code from above 
}

function run(mon) {
  let [x, logs] = mon([]);
  let logStr = logs.join("\n");
  window.alert(logStr);
  return x;
}

function fibonacci(n) {
  // TODO: Modify this code
  // Note: Make sure you use log, ret, and bind
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}

///// SOLUTION
function ret(a) {
  return function(logs) { return [a, logs]; }
}

function bind(mon, func) {
  return function(logs) { let [x, logs1] = mon(logs); return func(x)(logs1); }
}

function log(msg) {
  return function(logs) { return [null, [...logs, msg]]; }
}

function run(mon) {
  let [x, logs] = mon([]);
  let logStr = logs.join("\n");
  window.alert(logStr);
  return x;
}

function fibonacci(n) {
  return bind(log(n.toString()), _ => {
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
        return ret(1);
    } else {
      return bind(fibonacci(n - 1), n1 => {
        return bind(fibonacci(n - 2), n2 => {
          return ret(n1 + n2);
        })
      })
    }
  });
}

///// TESTS
fibonacci(0)([]) ==> [1,["0"]]
fibonacci(1)([]) ==> [1,["1"]]
fibonacci(2)([]) ==> [2,["2","1","0"]]
fibonacci(5)([]) ==> [8,["5","4","3","2","1","0","1","2","1","0","3","2","1","0","1"]]
run(fibonacci(5)) ==> 8
