# Lesson 3.1: Writer monad

From the previous lesson, we have the Counter monad:

```typescript
type Mon<A> = (c: number) => [A, number]

function ret<A>(n: A): Mon<A> {
    return function(c) { return [n, c]; }
}

function bind<A, B>(m: A, fn: (n: A) => Mon<B>): Mon<B> {
    return function(c) {
        let [x, nc] = m(c);
        return f(x)(nc);
    }
}

function tick<A>(m: Mon<A>): Mon<A> {
    return function(c) { return m(c + 1); }
}
```

Of course, we can do more than just counting. Suppose that instead of a number, we had an array, and instead of incrementing we had appending. Let's see how this works out.

**Problem 3.2.0:** Rework the Counter monad to become a Logger monad: instead of passing around a single number, we pass around a list of strings that we increment.

Hint 1: To give you an idea of what you're doing, we did the `log` and `run` operations for you. The `log` operation returns a function that appends a new string to the log.
 
Hint 2: There's surprisingly little you need to change in `ret` or `bind`.

```problem
type Mon<A> = (l: string[]) => [A, string[]];

function ret<A>(a: A): Mon<A> {
    // Your code here 
}

function bind<A, B>(m: Mon<A>, fn: (a: A) => Mon<B>): Mon<B> {
    // Your code here 
}

function run<A>(m: Mon<A>): [A, string[]] {
    return m([]);
}

function log(msg: string): Mon<null> {
    return function (l: string[]) {
        // Need to create deep copy of array
        let nl = Array.from(l);
        nl.push(msg);
        return [null, nl];
    }
}
```

Yay, we have a list of strings. What can we do with them? One thing we can do is create a log of comments, errors, etc. that we can eventually print out. Usually, we print to a console:

```typescript
function run<A>(m: Mon<A>): A {
    let [result, log] = m([]);
    for (i = 0; i < log.length; ++i) {
        console.log(log[i]);
    }
```

But this is JavaScript world. We can do better, such as giving output to a window popup.

**Problem 3.2.1:** Redo `run` such that it prints out every string in the list in a window popup. In addition, the previous code wasn't very functional - redo it in a functional manner (ie. no `for` or `while` loops).

```problem
type Mon<A> = (l: string[]) => [A, string[]];

function run<A>(m: Mon<A>): A {
    // Your code here
}
```

And thus the IO monad was born. No seriously - any IO monad, such as the Logger monad, is simply an example of a State monad, as we will see shortly.
