# Lesson 3.1: The Counter Monad

In the previous lesson, you probably wrote something like this:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, count) {
  let count1 = count + 1;
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return [1, count1];
  } else {
    let [a1, count2] = fibonacci(n - 1, count1);
    let [a2, count3] = fibonacci(n - 2, count2);
    return [a1 + a2, count3];
  }
}
```

Instead of returning just the n-th fibonacci number, we return a tuple in the form `[a, count]`. The first element of our tuple is our original return value, while the second element is the final count we made. In this case, that count is the number of calls to `fibonacci` we've made.

Notice how the we _thread_ the count through our calls to `fibonacci`. After our initial increment of the count, we first pass it to our first inner call to `fibonacci` and get the result `count2`. Then we pass `count2` to the second inner call to `fibonacci` and get the result `count3`, which we then return in the tuple as our final answer.

But suppose we don't want to pollute our beautiful functions with extra arguments and return extra crud. We want some way to abstract these side effects away, to wrap them somehow.

Hmm. Looks like it's (counter) monad time!

First, how do we make `ret`, ie. how do we wrap our value + count combo? Let's start with the simplest possible function we can make with the value and counter, the identity function:

```javascript
function identity(n, count) {
  return [n, count];
}

identity("two", 2); // Returns ["two", 2]
```

Now, let's take advantage of the fact that we can rewrite any two-argument function as two nested one-argument functions:

```javascript
function identity(n) {
  return function(count) {
    return [n, count];
  }
}

identity("two")(2); // Also returns ["two", 2]
```

(Note: this idea of turning multiple-argument functions into a bunch of one-argument functions has a fancy-schmancy name: _currying_.)

In both versions of the `identity` function, we can call the arguments in order and get back a `[n, count]` tuple. But in the second example, we are no longer forced to deal with an explicit `count` argument in our `identity` function. Instead, we moved it to an auxillary inner function that we can let the monad deal with, so the user doesn't have to.

Also note that by wrapping our computation in the inner function, we "freeze" said computation. Thus, instead of immediately evaluating the function, we can pass the function around like any other piece of data. Then the function needs to wait before it can receive an argument (like a `count`) and evaluate it, which will be useful in places like `bind`.

But for now, let's see our `ret` function:

```javascript
function ret(n) {
  // This function is our monadic wrapper
  return function(count) {
    return [n, count];
  }
}
```

Which is literally the same thing as `identity`, except that we gave it a new name.

So that is a cool idea: using a function (instead of a class or interface) to wrap a value like `n`. But once we wrap `n`, how do we use it? That's where `bind` comes in:

```javascript
function bind(mon, func) {
  return function(count) {
    let [x, count1] = mon(count);
      return func(x)(count1);
  }
}
```

In `bind`, we first unwrap the monad by passing in a `count`; we get back a `[x, count1]` tuple when we call `mon(count)`. Here, `mon` is a function that receives a `count`, which may update the `count` by, for example, incrementing it.

Then we take the function `func` we have as an argument to `bind`, pass in the value `x` in `func(x)`, and get back another function that takes in a count. we then pass in our new count `count1` to get back the final tuple.

Now that we have a way to wrap data, how do we unwrap it? Simple: pass in an initial `count` value. Then as the monad (which is a function) does its job, it will increment (or decrement) the `count` it receives, and returns a `[value, count]` tuple. This is the basis of the `run` operation:

```javascript
function run(mon) {
  return mon(0);
}
```

Here, we need to pass in a 0, because we always count up from 0. (Because we're computer scientists. Suck it, mathematicians!)

Cool, we have our monad, but what can we do with it? For starters, we need a way to increment the counter:

```javascript
function tick(mon) {
  return function(count) {
    return mon(count + 1);
  }
}
```

As you can see, inside `tick`'s inner function, we take the `count` and increment it. Then we pass the increment count into `mon`, which returns a `[value, count]` tuple.

**Problem 3.1.0:** Rewrite `fibonacci` so that it uses the Counter monad. To ensure that you are using the monad, make `fibonacci` return a monadic value (ie. a function that takes in a `count` and returns a `[value, count]` tuple), instead of a number.

```problem
///// CODE
function ret(n) {
  return function(count) {
    return [n, count];
  }
}

function bind(mon, func) {
  return function(count) {
    let [x, count1] = mon(count);
    return func(x)(count1);
  }
}

function tick(mon) {
  return function(count) {
    return mon(count + 1);
  }
}

function run(mon) {
  return mon(0);
}

function fibonacci(n) {
  // TODO: Change all of this code
  // Note: Make sure you use tick, ret, and bind here
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}

///// SOLUTION
function ret(n) {
  return function(count) {
    return [n, count];
  }
}

function bind(mon, func) {
  return function(count) {
    let [x, count1] = mon(count);
    return func(x)(count1);
  }
}

function tick(mon) {
  return function(count) {
    return mon(count + 1);
  }
}

function run(mon) {
  return mon(0);
}

function fibonacci(n) {
  return bind(tick(ret(n)), _ => {
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
      return ret(1);
    } else {
      return bind(fibonacci(n - 1), n1 => {
        return bind(fibonacci(n - 2), n2 => {
          return ret(n1 + n2);
        })
      });
    }
  });
}
