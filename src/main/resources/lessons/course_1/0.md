# Lesson 1.0: What is a monad?

Greetings square one. We are so happy that you’ve started on your journey to the strange world of monads! Monads have been the talk of legends and memes the world over, and you may be scared that monads are super, super, super hard.

In particular, monads are difficult to teach. It's often said that once you finally understand monads, you'll be magically be unable to explain them to others.

Like you may have seen the following definition:

Monad (noun):
1. A monoid in the category of endofunctors.
2. A burrito.

For regular folks like you and me, both definitions are weird, confusing, and obscure what a monad really is. But before we move on to some better definitions, let’s spend some time on those two confusing ones.

The first definition is actually a joke from [this humorous blog post](http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html):

> 1990 - A committee formed by Simon Peyton-Jones, Paul Hudak, Philip Wadler, Ashton Kutcher, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals creates Haskell, a pure, non-strict, functional language. Haskell gets some resistance due to the complexity of using monads to control side effects. Wadler tries to appease critics by explaining that "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?"

It did start out as a serious definition that was derived from the mathematical field of category theory. But math is hard, so we're going to show as little math as possible.

But there's still stuff we can glean from that first definition. For example, what is a "monoid"? We will find out in the next lesson.
