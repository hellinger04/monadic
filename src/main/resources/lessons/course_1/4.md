# Lesson 1.4: Pulling back the green curtain 

Let's make a general monad so we can get the basic idea about the point. You're going to make a monad from nothing. 

**Problem 1.4.0:** Let's first make a bunch of functions. Nothing special, just a bunch of plain old functions.

```problem
///// CODE
function exciteMe(x) {
  // You're having a good day, and you are exciteed!
  // Celebrate by adding five exclamation points to x
  return x + "!!!!!";
}

function exciteMeMore(x) {
  // You're getting too excited now, and you're mistyping your exclamation points.
  // Add three 1's to x
  return x + "111";
}

function run() {
  let x = "Hello World";
  let y = exciteMe(x);
  let z = exciteMeMore(y);
  return z;
}

///// TESTS
exciteMe("Hi") ==> "Hi!!!!!"
exciteMeMore("OMG!!!!!") ==> "OMG!!!!!111"
run() ==> "Hello World!!!!!111"

///// LANGUAGE
JavaScript
```

This is the kind of program you're used to, right? No surprises there. If you implemented your functions correctly, you put in "Hello World" and get out "Hello World!!!!!111"

**Problem 1.4.1:** Now, add a function called `wrapper`. It should just return `x`. Then, make a function called `applyFunc` that applies the function to the `x` that you just wrapped.

```problem
///// CODE
function exciteMe(x) {
  // Copy-paste code from above 
  return x + "!!!!!";
}

function exciteMeMore(x) {
  // Copy-paste code from above
  return x + "111";
}

function wrapper(x) {
  // Wrap it!
}

function applyFunc(x, func) {
  // Apply the func to the x!
}

function run() {
  let x = "Hello World"
  let y = wrapper(x)
  let z = applyFunc(y, exciteMe);
  let w = applyFunc(z, exciteMeMore);
  return w;
}

///// TESTS
run() ==> "Hello World!!!!!111"

///// LANGUAGE
JavaScript
```

This program does the same thing as the last one, but now instead of calling your functions directly, you pass them to a function that does it for you. That's your higher order function, where you give the function a function as an argument. 

You can see, this is the same program as before. Instead of calling the functions directly, we give them to `applyFunc` to call them with whatever we want as a parameter.

At this point, you already have a monad!
