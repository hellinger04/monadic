# Lesson 1.4: Pulling back the green curtain 

Let's make a general monad so we can get the basic idea about the point. You're going to make a monad from nothing. 

**Problem 1.4.0:** Let's first make a bunch of functions. Nothing special, just a bunch of plain old functions.

```problem
function excitedHelloWorld(x) {
    // Concatenate as many exclamation points as you want to x,
    // which will be 'hello world' in this case.
    // Decide on the amount by how excited you are to
    // be in the world, and return the new string.
}

function tellASecret(x) {
  // Concatenate a string that contains a secret you have
  // to whatever x is and return the new string.
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    // Concatenate a string with the best gossip you know
    // to x and return the new string
}

function run() {
    let x = "Hello World";
    let x = excitedHelloWorld(x);
    let x = tellASecret(x);
    let x = bestGossip(x);
    return x;
}

console.log(run());

// TESTS
```

This is the type of program you are used to and there shouldn't be any surprises. You can see in the console, you say hello to the world, you see the secret you told and then you can read the best gossip you know.

**Problem 1.4.1:** Now, add a function called `wrapper`. It should just return `x`. Then, make a function called `applyFunc` that applies the function to the `x` that you just wrapped.

```problem
function excitedHelloWorld(x) {
    // Copy-paste your excitedHelloWorld code from above
}

function tellASecret(x) {
    // Copy-paste your tellASecret code from above
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    // Copy-paste your bestGossip code from above
}

function wrapper(x) {
    // Wrap it!
}

function applyFunc(x, func) {
    // Apply the func to the x!
}

function run() {
    x = "Hello World"
    x = wrapper(x)
    x = applyFunc(x, excitedHelloWorld);
    x = applyFunc(x, tellASecret);
    x = applyFunc(x, bestGossip);
}

console.log(run());

// TESTS
```

This program does the same thing as the last one, but now instead of calling your functions directly, you pass them to a function that does it for you. That's your higher order function, where you give the function a function as an argument. 

You can see, this is the same program as before. Instead of calling the functions directly, we give them to `applyFunc` to call them with whatever we want as a parameter.

At this point, you already have a monad!
