# Lesson 1.6: Let's go to Chipotle!

To be precise, all monads have three basic components:

- A _monadic type_, which is a wrapper type of our regular data.

- `ret`: An operation that wraps data.

- `bind`: An operation that takes a wrapped object and a function to get another wrapped object.

In addition, while technically not required, many monads have this additional operation:

- `run`: An operation that runs our monad and returns and unwrapped object.

Remember the second definition that we introduced? That monads are burritos? Although you can’t order a monad at Chipotle, monads are similar to burritos in that they wrap stuff. Just like how a burrito wraps meat and guacamole in a tortilla shell, a monad wraps an underlying data, like integers or strings, into new forms of data.

(And just for fun, [here’s a cartoon of the whole “monads being burrito” thing](https://chrisdone.com/posts/monads-are-burritos/))

So that’s one way of thinking about monads. Some monad operations wrap data, some unwrap data, and some stuff that data into functions.

To use the burrito analogy:

- Underlying data = the filling

- Monadic type = the filling + tortilla

- `ret` = the guy who wraps the burrito

- `bind` = the guy who puts more fillings in the burrito

- `run` = the guy who eats the burrito

Yay, so we have this monad that does stuff. But where can we use it? Turns out, we can use it in lots of places, usually to isolate side effects in functional programming. (Don’t know what that sentence means? Go to Course 0!) With a monad, we can create a space in our program to do all of the side effects we want, from exceptions to state to I/O, and then once we’re done we can call `run` to run our monad, unwrap all of our wrapped objects and go back to pure function land.

That’s why monads are often described as a design pattern: these operations are used in so many places to isolate many different kinds of side effects, so it would make sense to point out the commonalities and put them into one place.

Ok, you’re probably still confused as to what a monad is. And you’re probably confused on where to use monads in the first place. And you’re probably hungry for burritos. Let’s start with an example of a simple but practical side effect: exceptions.
