# Lesson 1.3: Functional Exceptions Part 2

In the previous lesson, you probably made a `raise` function that looks like this:

```javascript
function raise() {
  return "Fail!"
}
```

And you probably made a `tryWith` function that looks like this:

```javascript
function tryWith(result) {
  if (result === "Fail!") {
    return "Error!";
  } else {
    return result;
  }
}
```

It's clear that this is not exactly the most sophisticated of implementations. Some might even call it a hack! The downsides of this approach are obvious. For starters, lots of things, not just our `raise` function, return `"Fail!"`, so we might catch an excetion where none actually existed.

Instead of using strings or `null` values or whatever, what if we made our own custom object for exceptions? Good thing we have classes in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Exn {
  constructor(errorMsg) {
    this.errorMsg = errorMsg;
  }
}

function raise(msg) {
  return new Exn(msg);
}
```

Then on the `tryWith` side of things, we can write:

```javascript
function tryWith(result) {
  if (result instanceof Exn) {
    return "Error!";
  } else {
    return result;
  }
}
```

**Problem 1.3.0:** Use this new kind of exception (with the `Exn` class) in the `tryDivide` method.
