Granted, this is a simplistic example; you would never write code like this in real life. But imagine a world without exception handling. If a piece of code blows up, say it divides by zero, it can wreak havoc on the rest of the program, potentially causing it to crash and spawn universe-consuming black holes.

Ok, maybe not the last part. But division by zero is bad, so we need exception handling.

As we see, JavaScript has its own exception handling capabilities. How cute. Letâ€™s rebuild it from scratch, this time in a functional manner!
