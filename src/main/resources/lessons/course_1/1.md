# Lesson 1.1: What is a function from type A to the same type?

At this point you should know about functional programing, either as background knowledge, or from doing Course 0. In Course 0, we said that one of the main ideas of functional programming is that functions are the same as data, and we can treat them the same way. Just as easily as we can pass a function an int, a string, or any other type, we can pass a function another function.

Next, we're going to talk about function from type A to the same types. Don't wimp out from hearing that word. It's really very simple. All a function from type A to the same type is is a function that goes from some type, to that same type.

I know you know javascript, but maybe you know python, too. Have you noticed in Python 3 that you can say 

```python
def soFun(self, s: str) -> str:
    return s
```

This is a function, from string to string. That's all a function from type A to the same type is. Python 3 is saying it that way because it's trying to be functional. It is asserting `s` is of type `str`, and that the function returns a string.

(And yes, apparently you can write out types in Python.)

This can count for any type. Let's say we have a generic type, which you probably know about. Let's call the generic type `AnythingAtAll`. So we could do this:

```python
def DontBeAfraid(self, a: AnythingAtAll) -> AnythingAtAll:
    return a
```

It's very simple and I know you are still following. That's all a function from type A to the same type is. Now you know. What is unclear is what's so scary about this. A function from type A to the same type is not Beetlejuice. Nobody comes to get you if you say it three times.

**Problem 1.1.0:** Make your own function from type A to the same type in Javascript:

```problem
///// CODE
function myaToa(x) {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

///// SOLUTION
function myaToa(x) {
  return x; // Identity function as solution
}

///// TESTS
typeof myaToa(5) ==> "number"
typeof myaToa(true) ==> "boolean"
typeof myaToa("This is a string") ==> "string"

///// LANGUAGE
JavaScript
```

**Problem 1.1.1:** Writing function from type A to the same types in JavaScript is fun and all, but wouldn't it be nice to write out the types, like in our Python example? The good news is that that's what TypeScript was made for. Write a function from type A to the same type that takes in a string as argument and returns a string.

```problem
///// CODE
// Notice the new type syntax in myaToa

function myaToa(x: string): string {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

///// SOLUTION
function myaToa(x: string): string {
  return x;
}

///// TESTS
typeof myaToa("This is a string") ==> "string"
typeof myaToa("") ==> "string"

///// LANGUAGE
TypeScript
```
