# Lesson 1.1: What is a function from type A to the same type?

At this point you should know about functional programing, either as background knowledge, or from doing Course 0. In Course 0, we said that one of the main ideas of functional programming is that functions are the same as data, and we can treat them the same way. Just as easily as we can pass a function an `number`, a `string`, or any other type, we can pass a function another function.

Next, we're going to talk about a function that takes in an argument of some type and returns something of the same type. We know you know Javascript, but maybe you know Python, too. Have you noticed in Python 3 that you can say 

```python
def soFun(self, s: str) -> str:
    return s
```

This is a function, from string to string. That's all a function from a type to the same type is. Python 3 is saying it that way because it's trying to be functional. It is asserting `s` is of type `str`, and that the function returns a string.

This can count for any type. Let's say we have a _generic type_, which you probably know about. Let's call the generic type `anythingAtAll`. So we could do this:

```python
def DontBeAfraid(self, a: anythingAtAll) -> anythingAtAll:
    return a
```

It's very simple and I know you are still following. That's all a function from type `A` to the type `A` is. Now you know. What is unclear is what's so scary about this. It's not Beetlejuice. Nobody comes to get you if you say it three times.

**Problem 1.1.0:** Make your own function from type `A` to type `A` in Javascript:

```problem
///// CODE
function myaToa(x) {
  // TODO: Your code here
}

///// SOLUTION
function myaToa(x) {
  return x; // Identity function as solution
}

///// TESTS
typeof myaToa(5) ==> "number"
typeof myaToa(true) ==> "boolean"
typeof myaToa("This is a string") ==> "string"

///// LANGUAGE
JavaScript
```

Fun fact: an `AnythingAtAll` type _does_ exist in TypeScript, if you were wondering. It's called the `any` type, and is basically a super-type for `number`, `string`, and all the other types possible in TypeScript. Thus, we can have a function like this:

```typescript
function myFunction(x: any): any {
  // Some code here
}
```

But say we want to be a bit more specific than `any`, but we don't know what we're dealing with in advance. We could be handling `string` data, `number` data, `pig` data, and so on. In TypeScript, we can declare generic types by putting it in angle brackets next to the function:

```typescript
function myFunction<A>(x: A): A {
  // Some code here
}
```
