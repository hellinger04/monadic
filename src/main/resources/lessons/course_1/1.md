# Lesson 1.1: What is a monoid?

At this point you should know about functional programing, either as background knowledge, or from doing Course 0. In Course 0, we said that one of the main ideas of functional programming is that functions are the same as data, and we can treat them the same way. Just as easily as we can pass afunction an int, a string, or any other type, we can pass a function another function.

Next, we're going to talk about monoids. Don't wimp out from hearing that word. It's really very simple. All a monoid is is a function that goes from some type, to that same type.

I know you know javascript, but maybe you know python, too. Have you noticed in python 3 that you can say 

```python
def soFun(self, s: str) -> str:
    return s
```

This is a function, from string to string. That's all a monoid is. Python 3 is saying it that way because it's trying to be functional. It is asserting `s` is of type `str`, and that the function returns a string.

This can count for any type. Let's say we have a generic type, which you probably know about. Let's call the generic type `AnythingAtAll`. So we could do this:

```python
def DontBeAfraid(self, a: AnythingAtAll) -> AnythingAtAll:
    return a
```

It's very simple and I know you are still following. That's all a monoid is. Now you know. What is unclear is what's so scary about this. A monoid is not Beetlejuice. Nobody comes to get you if you say it three times.

_Not a monoid_

**Problem 1.1.0:** Make your own monoid in Javascript:

// TODO Problems don't work if there's no code
```problem
function myMonoid(x) {
  // Your code here
}

// TESTS
```
