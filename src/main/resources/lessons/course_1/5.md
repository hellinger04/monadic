# Lesson 1.5: Working with your monad 

So, you just made your own monad! All you need is the wrapper (usually called `ret`) and applyFunc (normally called `bind`). 

We already talked about monads.

We had:

```text
funFunction: AnythingAtAll -> transform(AnythingAtAll)
```

We can also have

```text
ret: string -> transform(string)
```

In the case you just wrote, that we have below, you can see that our `transform` is currently doing nothing. We don't care what it does! Doing nothing is fine.

Still, we're calling it `ret` because that's the standard. It's what we called `wrapper` in the previous lesson. It's still doing the same thing! It's just a wrapper function.

**Problem 1.5.0:** Go ahead and make `ret` actually wrap it! Add parentheses to each side of the string in `ret`. This will be the `transform` operation. Let's informally call this type `(x)` because it will put the x in parens.

```problem
function exciteMe(x) {
  return x + "!!!!!";
}

function exciteMeMore(x) {
  return x + "111";
}

function ret(x) {
  // Your code here
  return "(" + x + ")";
}

/*
function run() {
  x = "Hello World"
  x = wrapper(x)
    x = bind(x, excitedHelloWorld);
    x = bind(x, tellASecret);
    x = bind(x, bestGossip);
}
*/

// TESTS
ret("Hello World") ==> "(Hello World)"
ret(exciteMe("Hello World")) ==> "(Hello World!!!!!)"
ret(exciteMeMore(exciteMe("Hello World"))) ==> "(Hello World!!!!!111)"
```

**Problem 1.5.1:** Now, if you run this, you're gonna get parens all over the place!!! We want `ret` to do a transform of the string, but we actually want the string itself when we run the function. Write the code for `bind` where you take `x` back out of the parens before passing it to your function!

```problem
function exciteMe(x) {
  return x + "!!!!!";
}

function exciteMeMore(x) {
  return x + "111";
}

function ret(x) {
  // Copy paste your ret code from above 
  return "(" + x + ")";
}

function bind(x, func) {
  // Your code here
  let newx = x.slice(1, x.length - 1);
  return func(newx);
}

// TESTS
ret("Hello World") ==> "(Hello World)"
bind("(Hello World)", exciteMe) ==> "Hello World!!!!!"
bind(ret("Hello World", exciteMeMore)) ==> "Hello World111"
```

**Problem 1.5.2:** Your `bind` function is cool and all, but the whole program is still buggy. Every function that `bind` takes needs to return something of type `(x)`1 Wrap whatever is returned from `exciteMe` and `exciteMeMore` in parens before returning it.

```problem
function exciteMe(x) {
  return "(" + x + "!!!!!" + ")";
}

function exciteMeMore(x) {
  return "(" + x + "111" + ")";
}

function ret(x) {
  // Copy paste your ret code from above 
  return "(" + x + ")";
}

function bind(x, func) {
  // Your code here
  let newx = x.slice(1, x.length - 1);
  return func(newx);
}

// Example of how ret and bind are used
// Note that x, y, and z are all of type '(x)'
function superExcited() {
  let x = ret("Hello World");
  let y = bind(x, exciteMe);
  let z = bind(y, exciteMeMore);
  return z;
}

// TESTS
ret("Hello World") ==> "(Hello World)"
bind("(Hello World)", exciteMe) ==> "(Hello World!!!!!)"
bind(ret("Hello World"), exciteMeMore) ==> "(Hello World111)"
superExcited() ==> "(Hello World!!!!!111)"
```

So we took the `(x)`, made it into an `x` so we could use it, then gave back an
`(x)` from bind.

The `ret` operation is the monad part - it does the transform.

The `bind` operation takes the `(x)` type value, and a function from `x` to `(x)` and returns an `(x)` type value.
