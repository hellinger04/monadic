# Lesson 1.5: Working with your monad 

So, you just made your own monad! All you need is the wrapper (usually called `ret`) and applyFunc (normally called `bind`). 

We already talked about monads.

We had:

```text
funFunction: AnythingAtAll -> transform(AnythingAtAll)
```

We can also have

```text
ret: string -> transform(string)
```

In the case you just wrote, that we have below, you can see that our `transform` is currently doing nothing. We don't care what it does! Doing nothing is fine.

Still, we're calling it `ret` because that's the standard. It's what we called `wrapper` in the previous lesson. It's still doing the same thing! It's just a wrapper function.

**Problem 1.5.0:** Go ahead and make `ret` actually wrap it! Add parentheses to each side of the string in `ret`. This will be the `transform` operation. Let's call this type `(x)` because it will put the x in parens.

```problem
function excitedHelloWorld(x) {
    return x + '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!';
}

function tellASecret(x) {
    return x + '\nI love eavesdropping';
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    return x + '\nLinus Torvalds is uncool';
}

function ret(x) {
    // Your code here
}

function run() {
    x = "Hello World"
    x = wrapper(x)
    x = bind(x, excitedHelloWorld);
    x = bind(x, tellASecret);
    x = bind(x, bestGossip);
}

console.log(run());

// TESTS
```

**Problem 1.5.1:** Now, if you run this, you're gonna get parens all over the place!!! We want `ret` to do a transform of the string, but we actually want the string itself when we run the function. Take it back out of the parens before passing it to bind!

```problem

function tellASecret(x) {
    return x + '\nI love eavesdropping';
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    return x + '\nLinus Torvalds is uncool';
}

function ret(x) {
    return x;
}

function bind(x, func) {
    return func(x);
}

function ret(x) {
    // Copy paste your ret code from above
}

function run() {
    x = "Hello World"
    x = wrapper(x)
    x = bind(x, excitedHelloWorld);
    x = bind(x, tellASecret);
    x = bind(x, bestGossip);
}

console.log(run());
```

**Problem 1.5.2:** Last, we still need to wrap the whole thing up in parens! Wrap whatever is returned from the `func` in parens before giving it back to `run`.

```problem

function tellASecret(x) {
    return x + '\nI love eavesdropping';
}

function bestGossip(x) {
    return x + '\nLinus Torvalds is uncool';
}

function ret(x) {
    return '(' + x + ')';
}

function bind(x, func) {
    return func(x);
}

function run() {
    x = "Hello World"
    x = wrapper(x)
    x = bind(x, excitedHelloWorld);
    x = bind(x, tellASecret);
    x = bind(x, bestGossip);
}

console.log(run());
```

So we took the `(x)`, made it into an `x` so we could use it, then gave back an
`(x)` from bind.

The `bestGossip` and `tellASecret` functions are monoids - they take a string and give back a string.

The `ret` operation is the monad part - it does the transform.

The `bind` operation takes the `(x)` type value, and a monoid (from `x` to `x`) and returns an `(x)` type value. The function maps type `x` to type `x`.
