# Lesson 1.0: What’s a Monad?

Greetings square one. We are so happy that you’ve started on your journey to the strange world of Monadland! It is a world that is the talk of legends and memes the world over, and you may be scared that monads are super, super, super hard. Like you may have seen the following definition:

Monad (noun):
1. A monoid in the category of endofunctors.
2. A burrito.

For regular folks like you and me, both definitions are weird, confusing, and obscure what a monad really is. In fact, monads are legendary in being difficult to explain. Thus results the saying: once you understand what a monad is, you’ll magically be unable to explain them to others.
